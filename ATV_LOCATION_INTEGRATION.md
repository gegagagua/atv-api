# ATV-Location Integration Complete

## ‚úÖ Successfully Added Location Field to ATVs

The ATV model now includes a complete location integration with the locations table.

## üîó Database Changes

### Migration Added
- **File**: `database/migrations/2025_09_08_223245_add_location_id_to_atvs_table.php`
- **Added**: `location_id` foreign key column to `atvs` table
- **Relationship**: Foreign key constraint to `locations` table
- **Behavior**: `ON DELETE SET NULL` (ATVs won't be deleted if location is removed)
- **Index**: Added index on `location_id` for performance

## üèóÔ∏è Model Relationships

### ATV Model Updates
```php
// Added to fillable array
'location_id'

// Added to casts
'location_id' => 'integer'

// Added relationship method
public function location(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Location::class);
}
```

### Location Model Updates
```php
// Added relationship method
public function atvs(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(Atv::class);
}
```
